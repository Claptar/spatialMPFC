# QC Directory Overview

This directory contains quality control (QC) analyses for spatial transcriptomics data across multiple species and datasets. Each subfolder holds Jupyter notebooks and a README specific to that dataset:

- `chimp/`: QC notebooks for chimpanzee samples.
- `human/`: QC notebooks for human samples.
- `macaque/`: QC notebooks for macaque samples.
- `spatial_libd/`: QC notebooks for spatialLIBD human dataset (data from [spatialLIBD GitHub](https://github.com/bioc/spatialLIBD)).

Use the README in each subfolder for detailed notebook descriptions and workflow instructions.
