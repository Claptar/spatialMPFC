- `EDA_QC_chimp_raw.ipynb`: Exploratory data analysis and initial QC on raw chimpanzee spatial data.
- `chimp_j8.ipynb`: QC analysis for sample `chimp_j8`, including metric calculation and threshold application.
- `chimp_j11.ipynb`: QC analysis for sample `chimp_j11`, including metric calculation and threshold application.
- `chimp_13302.ipynb`: QC analysis for sample `chimp_13302`, including metric calculation and threshold application.
- `chimp_13309.ipynb`: QC analysis for sample `chimp_13309`, including metric calculation and threshold application.
- `chimp_11454.ipynb`: QC analysis for sample `chimp_11454`, including metric calculation and threshold application.
