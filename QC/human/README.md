# Human QC Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for quality control (QC) of spatial transcriptomics data from human samples. Each notebook focuses on calculating per-spot metrics, applying thresholds, and visualizing QC results.

- `EDA_QC_human_raw.ipynb`: Exploratory data analysis and initial QC on raw human spatial data.
- `human_j3.ipynb`: QC analysis for sample `human_j3`, including metric calculation and threshold application.
- `human_j4.ipynb`: QC analysis for sample `human_j4`, including metric calculation and threshold application.
- `human_j6.ipynb`: QC analysis for sample `human_j6`, including metric calculation and threshold application.
- `human_j12.ipynb`: QC analysis for sample `human_j12`, covering spot-level filtering and visualization.
- `human_759.ipynb`: QC analysis for sample `human_759` with layer-specific thresholding.
